# Physics
Requirements:

Continuous and discrete inputs: Player moves mouse and clicks for angle they want to shoot ball,
then the ball goes on its own and bounces around the world to reach the goal

Goal can only be achieved indirectly: The player must launch ball and have it bounce to goal,
they cannot simply drag the ball over to the goal

3+ physics based gameplay scenes: My game includes 3 levels of scaling difficulty, each adding a new concept
to the previous levels

Other scenes used to separate the gameplay scenes: My game includes 3 summary screens, one after each level that tell the player the time they took to pass the level as well as the number of atempts it took them
